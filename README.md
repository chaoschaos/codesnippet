Tomboy is my favourite note-taking app, so I write this addin for him.
This addin could be used to add code snippets to notes.
I have no experience in C# nor Gtk before, so the addin maybe simple and
crude.
### Example

### Notice
Package gtksourceview2-sharp should be installed in your system 
```bash
#Install gtksourceview2-sharp under ubuntu 12
sudo apt-get install libgtksourceview2-2.0-cil
#Check if the package has been installed successfully
pkg-config --list-all | grep gtksourceview
```
